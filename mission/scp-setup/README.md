# Set up a SAP Business Technology Platform Account using Booster

## Introduction

For running this SAP SuccessFactors extension tutorial, you will need the following services in your SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) account.

* SAP Business Application Studio
* Event Mesh
* Enterprise Messaging Hub
* Cloud Foundry Runtime
* SAP HANA Cloud service
* SAP Build Work Zone, standard Edition
* SAP Continuous Integration & Delivery service (optional)

The entitlement differs for the pricing option of your account:

* **Consumption-based SAP BTP Account:** 
No entitlement necessary. Be sure that you have enough credits to run the services.

* **Subscription-based SAP BTP Account:** 
You have to create entitlements for the services above - [See Entitlements and Quotas](https://help.sap.com/viewer/df50977d8bfa4c9a8a063ddb37113c43/Cloud/en-US/38ecf59cdda64150a102cfaa62d5faab.html#loio363f0f68f9704830ac65c87a2562559b).

**SAP BTP Enterprise Aggreement**:‚ùóThis mission does not support the BTPEA pricing model.


To check how much these services would cost, use the [SAP BTP Estimator Tool](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-platform/pricing/estimator-tool.html?blueprintId=a0ad3bc5-4fcb-4008-b109-bd8f70634d6c)


You can either set up each service individually or use a dedicated booster that will automate the setup for you. To simplify the setup process, SAP has introduced Boosters. Boosters are a collection of wizards that provides functionalities for specific scenarios to automate and speed up the installation and configuration process of a SAP BTP sub-account. This also includes the user management with the mapping of the respective Administrator and Developer roles.

Before running the booster, please check for which regions and infrastructures the services are available. The booster is not able to check this in advance, so it will fail when you select a region where a service is not available.[See SAP Discovery Center Service Catalog](https://help.sap.com/doc/aa1ccd10da6c4337aa737df2ead1855b/Cloud/en-US/3b642f68227b4b1398d2ce1a5351389a.html).


**Persona:** Cloud Administrator (SAP BTP)

5. Now let us setup your BTP Subaccount, To learn more about global and subaccounts, refer to this [Account Model help page](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/8ed4a705efa0431b910056c0acdbf377.html)
   
   - You find the list of the Services that will be activated by the Booster. For this tutorial, there are also optional services like : **Continuous Integration & Delivery** service, if you don't want to use these services, you can remove this service before running the booster. 
   - The **Extension Center**, **Extension Factory, serverless runtime** service, **Application Logging**, **Application Autoscaler service** and **SAP Cloud Transport Management service** are not needed for this tutorial 
   - Select the **Remove** icon to remove them. This means they will not be set up when the Booster is completed.
   - We will need the **SAP Build Work Zone, standard Edition** service to run the sample HTML5 applications which use 'Managed Application Router', refer to [SAP Help - Developing HTML5 Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/11d77aa154f64c2e83cc9652a78bb985.html), so do not remove the **SAP Launchpad Service**.
   - Depending on if you have a **Cloud credit** based account or a **Subscription** account, below screenshot might vary accordingly:
