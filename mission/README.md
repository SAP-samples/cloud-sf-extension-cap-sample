# Mission: Business Events with SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Event Mesh


## Description

You can use SAP BTP to extend SAP SuccessFactors with extension applications running on the cloud platform. When building extension applications, you can also benefit from the automation of the integration between the cloud platform and SAP SuccessFactors.
Following the steps of this mission, you will learn about the different SAP SuccessFactors APIs you can use to build an extension application and the general process how you can achieve this starting from integrating SAP SuccessFactors and SAP BTP. 

In the end, you will be able to develop, deploy, and provision an extension application that would reside on SAP BTP and extend your SAP SuccessFactors functionality without disrupting the performance and the core processes.
